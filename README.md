# Repair Rush

## Inspiration
The initial challenge was coming up with a unique idea. By interpreting the theme of "Building" as a noun, the concept of a niche game was born where a repairman must prevent a building from collapsing.

## What it does
**Repair Rush** is a game where the player controls a repairman using keyboard inputs to move across the screen and patch holes forming on the side of a building. If too many holes appear without being repaired, the building falls apart, resulting in a game over.

## How it was built
The game was created using the **Ubisoft NEST game engine API** and written in **C++**. All in-game sprites, including both static and animated objects, were designed using **Aseprite** sprite sheets.

## Challenges
One of the main challenges during development was learning C++ and the nuances of game engine manipulation. Another hurdle was designing the game logic and flow, as some team members had limited experience in game development. Through collaboration and peer programming, these challenges were overcome.

## Accomplishments
The creation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) with a quirky, fun concept is a significant achievement. While time constraints limited the implementation of additional features, the game is functional and enjoyable.

## What was learned
The development process provided valuable insights into C++ fundamentals and how various components of a game engine come together to create a complete gaming experience.

## What's next for Repair Rush
Future plans for **Repair Rush** include adding multiple stages with increasing difficulty, along with obstacles such as falling debris to enhance the gameplay experience.
